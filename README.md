# WARNING: This is currently prerelease software!

Please note this is prerelease software and can only be used through
bundler. It also requires git depenencies of rake-pipline and
rake-pipeline-web-filers. It also requires CasperJS 1.0 RC1. If you
don't have any of that installed then you can turn back now. CasperJS
1.0 can be installed with homebrew on mac. Here's how you can boostrap.

First create a `Gemfile`

```
source :rubygems

gem 'iridium', :github => 'radiumsoftware/iridium'
gem "rake-pipeline", :github => "livingsocial/rake-pipeline"
gem "rake-pipeline-web-filters", :github => "wycats/rake-pipeline-web-filters"
```

Now bootstrap:

```
$ brew install casperjs # or upgrade
$ bundle
$ bundle exec iridium
```

Don't forget you **must use bundle exec!**

# Iridium: A Toolchain for JS Development

Iridium is a tool to help you with modern Javascript development. It's
here to make you a faster developer and solve common problems. It
focuses primarily on:

* CLI driven interactions
* Expose as little Ruby as possible
* Focus on JS/CSS/HTML
* Make JS testable

## Getting Started

Iridium supports the most common use case right out of the box. You have
a directory of assets that need to be compiled into a web application.
Iridium uses `Rake::Pipeline` and sensible defaults to make writing
structured and testable Javascript possible. The first step is to use
the built in generator to create the structure:

```
$ iridium app todos
    create  app
    create  app/dependencies
    create  app/dependencies/minispade.js
    create  app/images
    create  app/javascripts/app.coffee
    create  app/public
    create  app/stylesheets/app.scss
    create  app/vendor/javascripts
    create  app/vendor/stylesheets
    create  site
    create  test
    create  test/helper.coffee
    create  test/integration/navigation_test.coffee
    create  test/support/qunit.js
    create  test/unit/truth_test.coffee
    create  application.rb
```

Now your pipeline is ready. You can use the built in development server
to edit your JS/CSS files and reload the browser. 

```
$ cd todos
$ iridium server
>> Thin web server (v1.4.1 codename Chromeo)
>> Maximum connections set to 1024
>> Listening on 0.0.0.0:9292, CTRL+C to stop
```

Navigate to `http://localhost:9292` in your browser and you'll see a
blank canvas.

## JSLint

Coffescript is generated by default. You can write in Javscript if you
like. Iridium can run all your files through JSLint if you like.

```
$ iridium lint app/javascripts/app.js
$ iridium lint app/javascripts/models/* app/javascripts/controllers/*
$ iridium lint app/javascripts/**/*.js # this is the default!
```

## Running Tests

Iridium makes testing your JS easy. It does all the manual work for you.
It also unites your integration and unit tests into a single test suite.

```
$ iridium test
Run options: --seed 9851

# Running Tests:

.................................................................

2998 Test(s), 2998 Assertion(s), 2998 Passed, 0 Error(s), 0 Failure(s)
```

Integration tests use CasperJS and unit tests use qUnit. Stub tests are
generated with your application. These tests should pass out of the box
given you have the proper CapserJS version installed. All your tests are
run through the `iridium test` command. Here are some examples:

```
$ iridium test test/integration/foo.js
$ iridium test test/unit/bar.js
$ iridium test test/integration/* test/models/*
$ iridium test test/**/*_test.coffee
$ iridium test test/**/*_test.{coffee,js} # this is the default!
```

## The Test Runner

Iridium has an integrated test runner to execute integration and unit
tests. All tests are executed through CasperJS. Unit tests are written
using QUnit. Test suite configuration happens through
`test/helper.coffee`. You can also write this file in Javascript. It's
job is to create and export a `casper` function. It must return a casper
object. The casper object is used to execute all the tests.

I'll describe how the test runner works behind the scenes. This is vital
information if you want to customize the suite!

Here's the high level process for running a unit test:

1. Patch CasperJS to enable external requires
2. Setup the load path
3. Add `lib/iridium` to the load path. (All internal JS/CS files)
4. Add `your_app/test` to the load path. (So you can require your own files)
5. Require `your_app/test/helper`
6. Create a casper object
7. Navigate to a generated HTML page that has your application code in
   it
8. CasperJS injects all configured files
9. CasperJS ibjects all test files
10 . Execute test suite
11. Capture and report results

Here's the high level process for running an integration test

1. Patch CasperJS to enable external requires
2. Setup the load path
3.. Add `lib/iridium` to the load path. (All internal JS/CS files)
4. Add `your_app/test` to the load path. (So you can require your own files)
5. Require `your_app/test/helper`
6. Create a casper object
7. Boot a server that serves your app
8. Navigate to your app on the running server
8. Run a test
9. Capture and report results

More fun facts:

* CasperJS execeutes in a CommonJS type environment. **This is different
  than the default pipline!**

### The Test Helper

`test/helper.coffee` is the link between your code and requirements and
Iridium's test runner. Iridium's runner only needs a casper object.
There is an `Iridium` object that knows how to build a simple casper
object. It does a bunch of event and low level configuration to make it
all work. It also bundles the `scripts` to send with each request.

```coffeescript
class Helper
  # define the scripts we want to use. They are injected
  # in the order defined
  scripts: [
    'support/qunit,           # points to YOUR_APP/test/support/qunit.{|js|coffee}
    'iridium/qunit_adapter',  # points to IRIDIUM_JS/iridium/qunit_adapter.{|js|coffee}
  ]

  # use Iridium's factory with the configuration from this object
  iridium: ->
    # requireExternal uses the previously described load path
    _iridium = requireExternal('iridium').create()
    _iridium.scripts = @scripts
    _iridium

# Use the Helper's iridium method to build a proper casper object
exports.casper = (options) ->
  (new Helper).iridium().casper(options)
```

You may do whatever you want in this file. Iridium supports two testing
modes: integration and unit. You can use this attribute to decide what
scripts you want to include. Here's an example:

```coffeescript
iridium = requireExternal('iridium')

class Helper
  casper: (options) ->
    @iridium = iridium.Iridium.create()

    if @iridium.mode == 'unit'
      @iridium.scripts = [
        'support/qunit',
        'iridium/qunit_adapter'
      ]
    else
      @iridium.scripts = [
        'support/integration_helper',
        'support/request_logging'
      ]

    @iridium.casper(options)

exports.casper = (options) ->
  (new Helper).casper(options)
```

I've added `requireExternal`. This is work around method. CasperJS
allows you require files using an absolute path. The `requireExternal`
looks through the Iridium load path and translates successful matches
into absolute casper requires. You can use this method everywhere.

### Writing Unit Tests

Unit tests are written using QUnit by default. You may use all the
regular qunit trimmings. All files not in `test/integration` are assumed
to be unit tests. If you need to navigate to your app and _do_ something
then use an integration test!

### Writing Integration Tests

Writing integration is slightly different than the casper examples.
Iridium boot your app on: `http://localhost:7777` before running any
tests. One important compromise must be made to make the test runner
work. This is caused by casper's internal testing structure. Every test
executes in a `casper.Tester` context. Events comming from your tests go
through this object and back through casper. Iridium needs these events
to log tests. The event handlers are only bound to one particular test
object. All tests must go through the casper object defined in your
`test/helper`! This means: **Examples from the CasperJS website will NOT
work out of the box**. Here's an example that illustrates the problem

```coffeescript
# This test passes because it's using the already defined casper object
casper.start 'http://localhost:7777/', ->
  @test.assertHttpStatus(200, 'Server is up')

casper.run ->
  @test.done()
```

Here's a test that doesn't work:

```coffeescript
# This test passes because it's using the already defined casper object

# Adding this line breaks stuff!
var casper = require('casper').create()

casper.start 'http://localhost:7777/', ->
  @test.assertHttpStatus(200, 'Server is up')

casper.run ->
  @test.done()
```

This test will still run however it will not report anything back to
Iridium! This is because the event handlers are setup on the existing
capser instance and this test redfines the variable. Keep this in mind!
You've been warned.

## Advanced Configuration

Iridium is written with Javascript developers in mind. They may not have
experience in ruby. I've tried as much as I can to shield some
complexity from newbies. Each part of Iridium is hidden by default, but
can be generated and customized.


### Customizing the Asset pipeline

You may want to change the way assets are compiled. Iridium uses it's
own pipeline by default. You can override this by creating your
`Assetfile` inside the root directory. You can start with a blank slate,
or use a generator. The generator creates an `Assetfile` that does the
same thing as the internal pipeline. You may also access the `app`
method.

```
$ cd todos
$ iridium generate assetfile
    create Assetfile
```

### Customizing index.html

`index.html` is an annoying part of web development. You cannot start or
serve your application without an HTML page to load your JS. Iridium has
a built in `index.html` which loads your assets and dependencies. This
will work for most simple applications. You can override this by
providing your own `index.html` in `public`. You can create the file
yourself or use a generator. The generator creates a file that does the
same thing as the bundled `index.html`.

```
$ cd todos
$ iridium generate index
    create app/public/index.html.erb
```

### Customization per Environment

More complicated applications need to support different environment.
Common envrioments are: development, test, and production. Each
environment may have their own dependencies or tweaks. Usually this is a
pain. Customizations happen at the server level. You **code** should not
be environment specific! Use the generator to create the file structure.

```
$ cd todos
$ iridium generate envs
    create  config/development.rb
    create  config/test.rb
    create  config/production.rb
```

### Configuration, Middleware, and Proxying

Your application may need files that should not be compiled with the
main app code. `minispade` is the default example. You can specify these
files using `config.load`. These files defined here should exist in
`app/dependencies`. Here's an example:

```ruby
# application.rb
YourApp.configure do
  config.load :minispade
  config.load http://www.example.com/my_script.js
end
```

Your Iridium app is served as a rack app. You can inject your own
middleware as you like. Here's an example:

```ruby
# application.rb

YourApp.configure do
  # config.middleware mimics the Rack::Builder api
  config.middleware.use MyCustomMiddleware
end
```

Iridium also has basic proxy support for handling your backend API. You
should only use this proxy if the API does not support CORs or there is
some other issue with it. You may want to use this proxy in test mode to
point your app to a test server intead. Here's an example:

```
# application.rb
YourApp.configure do
  config.proxy "/api", "http://api.myproduct.com"
end
```

Proxies can be overwritten per env like this:

```
# application.rb
YourApp.configure do
  config.proxy "/api", "http://api.myproduct.com"
end

# config/test.rb
YourApp.configure do
  config.proxy "/api", "http://test-api.myproduct.com"
end
```

### Customizing The Unit Test Loader

Iridium uses a generated HTML file to load your test code into. You can
override this behavior by creating:
`test/support/unit_test_loader.html.erb`. 

Here's what the default ERB template looks like:

```erb
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>Unit Tests</title>

    <!--[if lt IE 9]>
      <script src="http://html5shim.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/html5.js"></script>
    <![endif]-->
  </head>

  <body>
    <% app.config.dependencies.each do |script| %>
      <script src="<%= script.url %>"></script>
    <% end %>

    <script src="application.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

### Deploying

JS applications are simply a collection of static assets in a diretory.
This is trival to serve up with Rack. Iridium apps are rack apps for
serving up the compiled directory. The server also handles caching,
proxying, and custom middleware. All you need to do is create a
`config.ru` file and you can deploy your app! You can also deploy your
app for free on Heroku out of the box.

```ruby
# config.ru
require File.expand_path('../application', __FILE__)

run MyApp
```

Or if you don't care about that, you can run the generator:

```
$ cd my_app
$ iridium generate rackup
```
