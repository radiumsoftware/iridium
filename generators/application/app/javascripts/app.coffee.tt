# This is your main javascript file. You can use write your entire application
# in this file if you like. Files are compiled into minispade modules
# based on the file name. All JS files inside "app/javascripts" are
# automatically prefixed with your application name. You can require
# this file like so:
#
#   require('<%= underscored %>/app')
#
# Files placed in "app/vendor/javascripts" are not prefixed at all.
# Say you downloaded jQuery to: "app/vendor/javascripts/jquery.min.js".
# You can require that code like so:
#
#   require('jquery')
#
# Any ".min" or version numbers are not included in the module name.
#
# This file makes all the code available. Your app is initialized in the
# boot file. Here's an example
#
#   require('jquery')
#   require('ember')
#   require('models')
#   require('views')
#   require('controllers')
#   require('helpers')
#
# Your application begins here...
